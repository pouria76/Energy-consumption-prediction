# Energy-consumption-prediction

Problem statement:
Given a dataset of energy consumed every hour for the years 2010 - 2018, this code provides an approach to predict the energy requirement for a day in the future.

Data:
Energy consumed in MWH for years 2010 - 2018 Columns : date_and_time (yyyy-mm-dd-hh), power_MWH

List of Deliverables:
- A structured data analysis to understand the nature of data
- Feature engineering: extracting or creating new features from the data that will help achieve the end goal (restrict to a max of 15 features), with statistical reasoning behind the selected features.
- Building a baseline model: need not use machine learning. Any model built will be evaluated against the baseline model.
- Building a simple parametric model with a reasonably good fit and explaining the model.
- Discussing one possible complex machine learning model and one complex parametric model that can be used and why.
